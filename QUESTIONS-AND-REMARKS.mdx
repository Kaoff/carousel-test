# After taking test

## About UI & UX

- Why is there an offset of the left on carousel items ? Is it on purpose ?
- Buttons for navigation and for 'add to watchlist' are very different. I'd add a border-radius on the navigation buttons to match the others.
- What should the navigation buttons do ? Show only the next item on the list ? Show the next 5 items ? SHould they hide in not usable or be disabled ?

## About GraphQL

- Why having both image and program.thumnail (typo here) ? Just having the thumbnail url is enough, isn't it ?
- Those are pretty long name for TV shows :)
- Certain images are not working :(
